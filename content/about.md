## About me
Hi, I am **isus203**. I am based in **Moscow, Russia**.

I am an Android enthusiast and developer focusing on system modifications, custom recoveries, and device tree maintenance.

## My Focus
My recent work involves development for Tecno devices (specifically KH7n), including:
- **Custom Recoveries:** Porting and maintaining OrangeFox and TWRP.
- **System Partitioning:** Tools for re-partitioning and GPT backup.
- **ROM Development:** Maintaining Device and Vendor trees for LineageOS.
